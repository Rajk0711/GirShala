BUSINESS MODEL
GIRSHALA
TRADITION YOU CAN TASTE
PURITY YOU CAN TRUST
High Milk Productivity:
Gir cows produce comparatively higher milk yields among indigenous breeds, typically 10–25
litres per day, ensuring a stable and scalable supply of A2 milk required for premium ghee
production while maintaining traditional dairy authenticity.
Climate Adaptability:
The breed is naturally suited to hot and semi-arid climates, making it ideal for regions like
Rajasthan and Chittorgarh, where consistent production is needed despite harsh weather
conditions.
Strong Disease Resistance & Moderate Maintenance:
Gir cows are heat tolerant, resilient, and require moderate maintenance compared to exotic
breeds, reducing operational risks and ensuring reliable year-round milk availability for
farmers.
Superior Ghee Production Quality:
Gir milk contains a good fat percentage, which improves ghee yield, aroma, texture, and
overall product quality—essential for positioning Girshala as a premium A2 ghee brand.
Brand Recognition & Consumer Trust:
The Gir breed is widely associated with purity, traditional Indian dairy heritage, and A2 milk,
providing natural branding advantages and stronger customer confidence in the product.
Support for Farmers & Indigenous Breeds:
Promoting Gir cow farming helps preserve indigenous cattle breeds while improving rural
farmer income through premium milk pricing and long-term partnerships.
Alignment with Girshala’s Vision:
Choosing Gir cows strengthens production reliability, sustainability, farmer empowerment,
and premium brand positioning, perfectly supporting Girshala’s mission of combining health,
tradition, and responsible dairy entrepreneurship.
why we can mix all types of milk produced by A2 cow
A2 quality depends on genetics, not breed: As long as all cows are A2A2 type, milk from
different indigenous breeds (Gir, Sahiwal, Rathi, Tharparkar, etc.) remains pure A2, so mixing
them does not affect health benefits or purity.
Only minor physical variations occur: Mixing breeds may slightly balance fat percentage,
aroma, or color, but it does not change nutritional value or A2 protein quality of the ghee.
Ensures stable and consistent supply: Different breeds perform well in different seasons and
climates, so mixing helps maintain continuous milk availability and avoids production
shortages.
Better for business sustainability: It reduces procurement risk, lowers overall milk cost,
allows partnerships with more farmers, and helps scale production while maintaining A2
authenticity.
why girshala is good brand name and how it it illigal to mix all A2
breeds milk
Not illegal if labeling is truthful: Mixing milk from different A2 indigenous breeds is legal as
long as the product is not falsely claimed as “only Gir cow ghee.” FSSAI rules focus on
accurate product description, not brand names.
Brand name does not define ingredients: A brand name like Girshala can represent
inspiration or heritage rather than a single breed, so using the name is legally acceptable
when marketing remains honest.
Proper labeling ensures compliance: By labeling the product as “A2 Desi Cow Ghee” or
“Made from indigenous cows,” the brand stays transparent and avoids misleading
consumers.
Good business and branding decision: Keeping the name Girshala builds strong
traditional and premium brand identity while allowing flexibility to source milk from
multiple A2 breeds, ensuring stable supply and future product expansion.
Milk Procurement & Collection Strategy – Girshala
1.  Village-Based Milk Procurement:
Girshala will procure fresh A2 milk directly from farmers located in nearby villages to
ensure quality control, freshness, and strong farmer relationships while eliminating
middlemen.
2.  Procurement Radius:
During the initial phase, milk collection will be conducted within an approximate 20 km
radius of the processing unit to minimize transportation time, maintain milk freshness,
and control logistics costs.
3.  On-Site Fat Testing & Quality Check:
At the time of milk collection, fat testing will be conducted immediately using a milk
analyzer. The fat percentage will determine the procurement price, ensuring
transparency and fair payment to farmers.
4.  Fat Content Range (Gir Cow Milk):
Gir cow milk typically contains a fat percentage ranging between 4.5% (minimum) and
5.5–6.5% (maximum under good feeding conditions), which is highly suitable for
premium ghee production.
5.  Milk Pricing Structure:
Based on fat content and quality results, the milk procurement price will range
approximately between ₹42 per litre (minimum quality slab) and ₹52 per litre (higher fat
and quality milk), encouraging farmers to maintain better animal care and milk quality.
6.  Farmer Payment System:
To build trust and ensure farmer satisfaction, payments will follow a Daily End-of-Day
(EOD) credit system, where farmers receive payments regularly without long waiting
periods.
7.  Transportation & Logistics:
Milk will be transported from villages to the processing unit using a tempo (tammpoo)
vehicle, allowing efficient collection from multiple farmers while maintaining timely
delivery for processing.
Farmer Support Initiative
Girshala will support farmers who are interested in purchasing cows but lack sufficient
financial resources by collaborating with banks and financial institutions that provide
livestock loans. We will simplify and assist in the loan application process by guiding farmers
with documentation, eligibility requirements, and approvals, making access to finance easier
and faster. This initiative will enable farmers to purchase indigenous A2 cows and become
long-term supply partners with Girshala, ensuring sustainable income opportunities for
farmers while helping us build a reliable and ethical milk procurement network
